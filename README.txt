This is my wiki for the work I am doing at the RedX as an employee/consultant. A few important things to note:

I didn't start on this project at the beginning of the semester. I spoke with Dr. Knutson well into the semester as I found that I couldn't do the group project due to my time constraints. 

The code I am working on is proprietary and cannot be shown. I will upload snippets into the “src” directory however to show the work that is being done.

All the deliverables required by the class (that I can legally give) are located under the “deliverables” directory.

Reports on the work that I am doing, the decisions that I am assisting in and the counsel I am giving are in the “reports” directory
